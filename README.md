# GURPS Character Sheet

GURPS[^1] Character Sheet (GCS) is a stand-alone, interactive, character sheet editor that allows you to build
characters for the [GURPS 4<sup>th</sup> Edition](http://www.sjgames.com/gurps) roleplaying game system.

GCS relies on another project of mine, [Unison](https://github.com/richardwilkes/unison),
for the UI and OS integration. The [prerequisites](https://github.com/richardwilkes/unison/blob/main/README.md) are
therefore the same as for that project. Once you have the prerequistes, you can build GCS by running the build script:
`./build.sh`. Add a `-h` to see available options.
